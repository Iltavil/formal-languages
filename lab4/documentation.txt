we start by splitting the reserved tokens in alphanumerical and not alphanumerical

we then make sure to split all the possible tokens with space so they are easy to tokenize

then we check to see if they are reserved. If they are not then we match them with regex. If they match we add them to the 
    symbol table, otherwise we raise error
